The process of training computers to learn from data without explicit programming is known as machine learning. 
Due to its abundance of strong libraries and frameworks that make it simple to build machine learning algorithms, 
Python is a well-known programming language for this purpose.A computer software that analyzes data can learn to 
forecast the outcome.Due to its strong frameworks, such scikit-learn-Machine Learning in Python and D3, which nearly perfectly satisfies all needs in this field, Python is a crucial component of AI programming languages.
